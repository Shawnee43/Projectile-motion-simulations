Hello! Attached below are a handful of motion simulations done on python notebooks. As of right now the simulations are quite basic in terms of the maths and code behind them, but I hope
to begin more complex problems as I progress my knowledge of coding and the required maths. I'm currently studying Physics at University College Dublin as a first year student.
